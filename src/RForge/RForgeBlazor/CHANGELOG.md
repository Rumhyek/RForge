# RForge.Blazor

## Unreleased

- Fixed `RfTreeView`: changing `AllowClick` after the first render now takes effect. The flag
  was only copied to the cascaded context at initialization, so revoking node clicks later was
  silently ignored and nodes stayed clickable (#98).
- Fixed `RfTreeNode`: a toggle click that arrives while an expand/collapse load is still in
  flight is now ignored. Previously it collapsed the node mid-load and raised a duplicate,
  misordered `NodeExpandChange`, leaving children under a collapsed node (#98).
- Fixed `RfDropDown` / `RfDropDownMulti`: the `CssClass` parameter is now applied to the dropdown root element and `CssFilterClass` to the filter input. Both parameters existed but were silently ignored; existing consumers that set them will now see their styles apply (#66).
- CI: merges to `main` no longer push packages to nuget.org. Each merge still builds and
  publishes packages to the GitHub package feed and creates a draft release; packages reach
  nuget.org only when a maintainer publishes a release (#116).
